# TaskWise - Task Management App

TaskWise is a simple yet powerful task management app built with React and TypeScript. This project helped me dive into the world of TypeScript and learn how to effectively use it with React Hooks, such as `useState`, `useRef`, and `useReducer`. It was my first fully developed project using TypeScript, and I gained a deeper understanding of how to pass props between components by defining prop types, ensuring type safety, and improving maintainability.

### What I Learned

- **TypeScript Integration**: As my first TypeScript project, I learned how to integrate it into a React app, which was a big challenge at first. Understanding how to define types, interfaces, and how to ensure type safety in a React environment was key to building this project.
  
- **React Hooks**: I got hands-on experience with `useState`, `useRef`, and `useReducer`. I learned how to manage state effectively and passed props with defined types between components, which made the app much more maintainable and easier to debug.

- **Drag-and-Drop**: I also integrated drag-and-drop functionality using React Beautiful DnD, which added an interactive layer to the app, making the task management experience more user-friendly.

### Challenges Faced

- **Learning TypeScript**: The biggest challenge was getting comfortable with TypeScript itself. Coming from a JavaScript background, it took me a little while to understand the full power of static typing, generics, and interfaces. However, once I grasped these concepts, I was able to leverage TypeScript to make the app more robust and error-free.

- **Prop Types**: Ensuring all components had the correct prop types and learning how to pass functions and data between components was also a new experience. I initially struggled with typing the state and props correctly, but it was rewarding when everything clicked into place.

Overall, I’m proud of how far I’ve come with TypeScript and how this project helped me overcome these challenges. It was a rewarding experience, and I feel much more confident using TypeScript in future projects!
